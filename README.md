# Small-Office-Network

## Scope

Small businesses represent 99.2% of UK enterprises, each requiring a robust, manageable, and cost-effective network infrastructure. Here I am trying to present a clear, repeatable blueprint for designing and deploying a network topology that’s both functional and easy to replicate across multiple small clients.

To make it more interesting and challenging we'll add things such as:

- **Ansible automation**  
  Automate device provisioning and configuration management to eliminate manual errors and speed up deployments.

- **Multi-tenant architecture**  
  Host “tenants” (smaller businesses) within the same building while ensuring proper network segregation.

- **VPN**
  Building a VPN so that remote users can access the company network and the network technician to be able to access the devices.
